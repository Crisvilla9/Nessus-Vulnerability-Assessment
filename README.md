# Nessus Vulnerability Assessment
<h2>Description</h2>
Practiced the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle. Used Nessus Essentials to scan local VMs hosted on VMWare Workstation in order run credentialed scans to discover vulnerabilities and remediate some of the vulnerabilities
<br />

First step was to turn off Domain, private and public firewalls off in my VMware. <br/>

After pinging my connection from my local machine to my VM, I was ready to do a Basic Network Scan. <br/>

<br />


<h2></h2>
<p align="center">
Received 31 mostly info vulnerabilities and one medium vulnerability after the basic network scan. <br/>

<h2></h2>
<p align="center">
Vulnerabilities in SMB Signing Disabled is a Medium risk vulnerability that is also high frequency. This is the most severe combination of security factors that exists and it is extremely important to find it on the network and fix it as soon as possible.<br/>

Next, I set up the VM to accept authenticated scans, and provide credentials to Nessus. Enabled Remote Registry which enabled the scanner to connect to the VM's registry. (this is done when a host is not domain joined)<br/>

<h2></h2>
<p align="center">
Provide a regitry key from Nessus to allow scans on this VM. <br/>

Providing Nessus with my admin credenetials from the VM to prepare a credentialed scan <br/>

<br />

<h2></h2>
<p align="center">
In the credentialed scan, I received a significant amount of Critical, high and medium vulnerabilities. (mixed results) <br/>

<h2></h2>
<p align="center">
Analysing the list of vulnerabilities, I find the Threat Level page, based on the CVSS metric scores where nessus lists and explains the threat levels of all the vulnerabilities. <br/>

<br />

<h2></h2>
<p align="center">
Just for demo purposes, I decided to download a deprecated version of Firefox and install it on the VM, just to see the scan results from nessus. <br/>

<br />

<h2></h2>
<p align="center">
141 vulnerabilities just from Firefox alone. This just shows how many vulnerabilities an outdates app may contain. Upgrading an app can resolve a lot of vulnerabilities all at once<br/>
